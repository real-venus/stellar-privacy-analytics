# Changelog

All notable changes to Stellar Privacy Analytics will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project structure and setup
- Privacy-first X-Ray analytics engine
- Stellar blockchain integration with Soroban smart contracts
- React frontend with privacy controls
- Node.js backend with encryption services
- Docker deployment configuration
- Comprehensive documentation
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Security
- End-to-end encryption using AES-256-GCM
- Differential privacy implementation
- Zero-knowledge proof architecture
- Privacy budget management system
- **UpgradeableProxy: add caller.require_auth() on all mutating entry points**
  (`initiate_upgrade`, `complete_upgrade`, `cancel_upgrade`, `set_upgrade_delay`,
  `transfer_admin`) to prevent caller-spoofing attacks where any contract could
  impersonate the admin by passing the stored admin Address as the `caller` argument.
  Fixes #297.
- **DataSovereigntyContract: keep check_access auth-free for cross-contract composability**
  Added a RelayContract inside the test suite that exercises `check_access` in a true
  contract-to-contract flow. If `caller.require_auth()` is ever re-introduced, the
  host-level auth panic fails the regression test. Fixes #294.
- **UpgradeableProxy: refactor with shared `verify_admin` helper and front-running protection**
  Centralized `caller.require_auth()` + stored-admin equality into a single
  `Self::verify_admin(&env, &caller)` helper used by every mutating entry point
  (`initiate_upgrade`, `complete_upgrade`, `cancel_upgrade`, `set_upgrade_delay`,
  `transfer_admin`). This prevents future mutating methods from accidentally
  omitting host-level auth.
- **UpgradeableProxy: require admin auth on `initialize`**
  Defense-in-depth against front-running between contract deployment and the
  legitimate admin's setup transaction.
